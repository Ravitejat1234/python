EDA:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the datasets (Customers.csv, Transactions.csv) into a suitable environment (Pandas DataFrames in Python). Handle missing values, data type conversions, and any inconsistencies.
Univariate Analysis:
Explore individual variables:
Customers: Age, Gender, City, Income, etc. (Descriptive statistics, histograms, box plots)
Transactions: Amount, Date, Product Category, etc. (Histograms, time series analysis)
Bivariate Analysis:
Analyze relationships between variables:
Customer-Transaction: Analyze how customer demographics (age, income) relate to purchase behavior (amount, frequency, product categories) using scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices.
Product-Transaction: Analyze product popularity, seasonality trends, and potential cross-selling opportunities.
Multivariate Analysis:
Explore the combined influence of multiple variables on customer behavior using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or other dimensionality reduction methods.
Business Insights:

Example Insights:
Identify high-value customer segments (e.g., "High-spending Young Professionals", "Loyal Seniors").
Determine peak purchase seasons or weekdays.
Discover product categories with high demand and potential for cross-selling.
Analyze customer churn risk based on purchase frequency and recency.
Identify regional variations in customer preferences and spending habits.
Task 2: Lookalike Model

Data Preparation:

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features from both customer and transaction data (e.g., purchase history, recency, frequency, monetary value, product preferences).
Data Transformation: Scale or normalize features to ensure they have a similar impact on the model.
Model Selection:

Consider options like:
Collaborative Filtering: (e.g., User-based, Item-based) to find customers with similar purchase histories.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Find customers in the feature space closest to the target customer.
Embedding-based models: (e.g., Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) to represent customers and products as vectors in a lower-dimensional space.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Train the chosen model.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain).
Generate Lookalikes:

For each of the first 20 customers, use the trained model to find the top 3 most similar customers and their similarity scores.
Task 3: Customer Segmentation

Data Preparation:

Feature Engineering: Similar to Task 2, create relevant features from customer and transaction data.
Clustering Algorithm:

Choose a suitable algorithm:
K-Means: Simple and efficient, but sensitive to initial cluster centers.
DBSCAN: Good for finding clusters of arbitrary shape, but can be sensitive to density parameters.
Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a hierarchy of clusters, but can be computationally expensive.
Determine Optimal Number of Clusters:

Use methods like the Elbow method, Silhouette analysis, or the DB Index to find the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster Analysis:

Apply the chosen clustering algorithm to the data.
Analyze cluster characteristics (e.g., average age, income, purchase behavior).
Evaluation and Visualization:

Calculate clustering metrics (e.g., DB Index, Silhouette score).
Visualize clusters using appropriate plots (e.g., scatter plots, dendrograms).
Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebooks/Python Scripts: Clean, well-documented code for each task.
PDF Reports:
Task 1: Concise and insightful business insights from the EDA.
Task 3: Detailed report on clustering results, including metrics, visualizations, and interpretations.
Evaluation Criteria:

Model Accuracy and Logic: Correct implementation of models, appropriate evaluation metrics.
Quality of Recommendations: Relevance and usefulness of lookalike recommendations.
Clustering Logic and Metrics: Appropriate choice of algorithm, accurate calculation of metrics, and meaningful interpretation of results.
Visualizations: Clear and informative visualizations to support the analysis.
Key Considerations:

Data Quality: The quality of your analysis heavily depends on the quality of the data. Ensure data cleaning and preprocessing are thorough.
Feature Engineering: The choice and engineering of features will significantly impact the performance of your models.
Model Selection: Choose models that are appropriate for the specific task and data characteristics.
Interpretation: Clearly explain the results of your analyses and their implications for the business.
Remember to adapt these steps and techniques based on the specific characteristics of the provided datasets and the business context.
